            This week was an introduction Web Development and the script <a  class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-html-term">HTML</a> which is used to build web pages. Html has a similar syntax to <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-xml-term">XML</a>, making it easier for me to understand, however html has defined tag names with specific semantic meanings and behaviour.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-html5-term">Html5</a> is not based on SGML; therefore does not have DTD files for standards, support for html5's new elements are variable.<a id="cit-ref1" href="#cit1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I try to make sure that any new element from Html5 is supported by the main browsers before using it.
        The <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-w3c-term">W3C</a> provides a validation tool<a id="cit-ref2" href="#cit2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> has been very useful to validate the html I write, it is akin to a compiler throwing up errors for me.

            Brackets is a modern text editor that makes it easy to design in the browser. It's crafted from the ground up for web designers and front-end developers.<a id="cit-ref3" href="#cit3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            This editor makes it far easier to create and organize code, with useful features like; coloured code, code hints and general code formatting.

    <section class="article-section" id="tags">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Elements</h3>
        
        <p>
            HTML has predefined tags as opposed to XML and this week we have learnt quite a lot of these tags, for example the anchor tag as discussed below. HTML5 with new semantic elements makes it more difficult to look at some examples before this new version as many div elements can be replaced with the new semantic tags.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The anchor tag defines a hyperlink in HTML5. It is normally used with a property of href, although not madatory and the tag will act as a placeholder for a hyperlink.<a id="cit-ref4" href="#cit4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Links can be relative or absolute, they join one web resource to another. Relative links are used to join resources found within the exisiting website folder.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-section" id="images">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Images</h3>
        
        <p>
            I learnt that images are placed with 'img' tags, however the knowledge of image formats and the original aspect ratio is incredibly important for displaying images appropriately. The alt property of an img tag can allow text readers to describe the image so I will put them on image to minimilize the difference in quality of the content despite how it is implemented. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In Html 5 the picture tag was introduced allowing an image to be mapped to a media query.<a id="cit-ref7" href="#cit7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The picture element allows aspect or size sensitive images to be replaced by a more appropriate image for the given device size.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Below are three examples all with a max width of 300px, all behaving differently due to their original respective size and aspect ratio and tags used to implement them.

        <p>
            I learnt this week that before <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-CSS-term">CSS</a>, tables were used for designing the layout of a webpage. Tables should only used only for displaying tabular data, for example a copy of my timetable(below).
        </p>

    <section class="article-section" id="lists">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Lists</h3>
        
        <p>
            This week I learnt more about lists, in previous weeks we had learnt about unordered and ordered lists. I learnt that these lists could be nested making a sub list within a list item. I was also introduced to the description list which has terms and description elements, perfect for something like a <a href ="#glossary"><strong>glossary</strong></a>.
        </p>
        
    </section>
        
    <section class="article-section" id="blockquotes">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Blockquotes</h3> 
        
        <p>
            I learnt about using the blockquote element when quoting a cited source and using the cite element for citation of the quote. However once reading the Morzilla and the W3school cite reference it is clear that the use of this element can vary depending on whether the W3C or WHATWG specification is used.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
        
        <p>  
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
            It's worth noting that the W3C specification says that a reference to a creative work, as included within a &lt;cite&gt; element, may include the name of the work’s author. However, the <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-whatwg-term">WHATWG</a> specification for &lt;cite&gt; says the opposite: that a person’s name must never be included, under any circumstances.<a id="cit-ref11" href="#cit11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
