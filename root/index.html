Html has a similar syntax to <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-xml-term">XML</a>, making it easier for me to understand, however html has defined tag names with specific semantic meanings and behaviour.

        <h3 class="sec-header">Elements</h3>
        
        <p>
            HTML has predefined tags as opposed to XML and this week we have learnt quite a lot of these tags, for example the anchor tag as discussed below. HTML5 with new semantic elements makes it more difficult to look at some examples before this new version as many div elements can be replaced with the new semantic tags.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The anchor tag defines a hyperlink in HTML5. It is normally used with a property of href, although not madatory and the tag will act as a placeholder for a hyperlink.<a id="cit-ref4" href="#cit4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Links can be relative or absolute, they join one web resource to another. Relative links are used to join resources found within the exisiting website folder.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-section" id="images">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Images</h3>
        
        <p>
            I learnt that images are placed with 'img' tags, however the knowledge of image formats and the original aspect ratio is incredibly important for displaying images appropriately. The alt property of an img tag can allow text readers to describe the image so I will put them on image to minimilize the difference in quality of the content despite how it is implemented. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In Html 5 the picture tag was introduced allowing an image to be mapped to a media query.<a id="cit-ref7" href="#cit7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The picture element allows aspect or size sensitive images to be replaced by a more appropriate image for the given device size.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Below are three examples all with a max width of 300px, all behaving differently due to their original respective size and aspect ratio and tags used to implement them.

            I learnt this week that before <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-CSS-term">CSS</a>, tables were used for designing the layout of a webpage. Tables should only used only for displaying tabular data, for example a copy of my timetable(below).

        <p>
            This week I learnt more about lists, in previous weeks we had learnt about unordered and ordered lists. I learnt that these lists could be nested making a sub list within a list item. I was also introduced to the description list which has terms and description elements, perfect for something like a <a href ="#glossary"><strong>glossary</strong></a>.

    <section class="article-section" id="blockquotes">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Blockquotes</h3> 
        
        <p>
            I learnt about using the blockquote element when quoting a cited source and using the cite element for citation of the quote. However once reading the Morzilla and the W3school cite reference it is clear that the use of this element can vary depending on whether the W3C or WHATWG specification is used.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
        
        <p>  
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
            It's worth noting that the W3C specification says that a reference to a creative work, as included within a &lt;cite&gt; element, may include the name of the work’s author. However, the <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-whatwg-term">WHATWG</a> specification for &lt;cite&gt; says the opposite: that a person’s name must never be included, under any circumstances.<a id="cit-ref11" href="#cit11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>

        <h3 class="sec-header">Linking & Inheritance</h3>
        
        <p>
            CSS, as mentioned previously, is used to control the displaying of Html elements. A Html document can include CSS directly with the style element or inline with the style property, however to completely seperate concerns the CSS should be in a seperate stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many Stylesheets can be used in a Html document and over the lifetime of the html document several references to the same element may be made. The Cascading notion in CSS, gives a simple clue that the order of styling makes a difference; however more then the order controls CSS inheritance. The below factors are what determine the style for any given element.<a id="cit-ref12a" href="#cit12"><sup>[12a]</sup></a>

            Elements can be styled in a number of ways, use of the element names can allow for a common theme and colour. The use of CSS classes can be used to group similar elements like a menu for a consistent display and actions on hover. Then individual elements can be styled using an id which must be unique to that Html document.

    <p>
        Font size is often defaulted to 16px but this is not guaranteed and setting the size of the font in the body is good practice. 
        When styling text we can also set multiple font-family properties the first being the preferred option then listing down. There are also more then just the default fonts to use, many external sources provide stylesheets with fonts that can be included in the head of the html document. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        There are many other techniques to styling text and CSS allows complete control over how a text block will look. The below example is a simple block of text in html, however with CSS styling the look of it can be changed completely!

        <h3 class="sec-header">Grid Layout</h3>
        
    <p>
        The Grid view technique was used previously in responsive design and needed a mix of Html and CSS dependency to represent a theoretical column view. Columns normally would be equidistant so that html elements would have classes like 'col-9' to denote a size of 75% in a 12 column grid view. This was a concept I did not like at all and seemed like a step back from the seperation of view concerns with CSS. <a id="cit-ref13" href="#cit13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
    </p>
   <picture class="example-img">
        <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="images/old_site_before_grid_small.png">
        <img src="images/old_site_before_grid_med.png" 
        alt="Image of old site design before grid layout"/>
    </picture>
    <p>    
        The Grid Layout in CSS, coupled with media queries, allows for great customisation of Html elements completely from CSS. This is a much better technique allowing for easy control of element position and sizing while retaining and hooking onto semantic classes or ids. <a id="cit-ref14" href="#cit14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>

        <h3 class="sec-header">Mobile First</h3>
        
    <p>
        I have found that many websites use a mobile first approach to design. This is so the base content and styling work on mobiles before adding embellishments for larger devices. This can lead to websites designed with a pseudo anti-desktop pattern and often don't take advantage of the available space of larger desktop or mouse functionality. In principle mobile first approach is very logical but, with all media, the developer needs to determine the target audience of the website both present and future where possible and the opinion of the business.

    <h3 class="sec-header">Flexible Images</h3>
        
    <p>
        Images can be made flexible in many different ways and the techinique depends on the type of image, format and context, and where on the page the image is placed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An image can be 'clipped' on resizing of the page meaning that instead of overflowing by default causing a horizontal scroll bar the image is clipped. The benefit of this is that the image keeps it's original size regardless of resizing however this means that part of the image is not seen on smaller devices. This technique is best for some header images and images that are repeated multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Resizing image is another techinque which normally sets the max-width property of an image to the max width of the image so that the image quality is not ruined by upscaling. When the page size is reduced the image will then scale down respectively, this is very useful but developers need to mindful of how potentially small the image could become on small devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Flexible images can used in conjunction with the float property so they can be displayed next to text or another media. In the CSS the width property should be set to the percentage of the parent element it should take up, and the float property needs to be set.

    <p>
        I learnt this week about adding video frames to hold video media on my webpage, and how to style it to be flexible in CSS. 
        
        This week we learnt about using an &lt;iframe&gt; element for an embedded video, however in HTML5 there is a new &lt;video&gt; element which makes it far easier. <a id="cit-ref15" href="#cit15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p> 
        The video element can be scaled in a similar fashion to images which makes flexible media very consistent in HTML5.

    <p>
        This week I learnt more about responsive design. In CSS3 the Flexbox layout allows for a card like interface which is very nice for styling of sequential information like tutorials. Flexbox is considered a one-dimensional layout as flexbox can only control either as a row or as a column <a id="cit-ref16" href="#cit16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.

        The above example uses the flexbox layout method. In this example I have used flexbox for columns to show a display of four options in their own columns, they are equal in width and the display is all done from CSS so they html is still semantically relevent.

    <section class="article-section" id="media-queries">
    <h2 class="sec-header">Media Queries</h2>
        
    <p>
        Media queries is the heart of responsive design, it allows the developer to query the screen size and then give differing CSS. The one issue I had very early on using Media Queries is that any CSS in the media query block is not more specific then out of the block. I have personally pushed my media queries to the bottom of the CSS so that if the specificity is the same the media block will override the other competeting CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above flexbox example uses a media query so that when the screen is smaller then the card size will be increased to 100% of the parent element. This allows the cards to remain a decent size while still being seperated in a meaniful way.

    <p>
        I learnt about HTML forms this week, this allows users to enter in information which now with HTML5 can partly be validated before being either validated by Javascript or server side by something like PHP. I have introduced a HTML form in the 'Contact Us' page, it will be styled and use HTML5 validation but won't have any connection to a server.

    <p>
        In CSS I also learnt about a different way of selecting elements for styling. <a id="cit-ref17" href="#cit17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Using the attribute selector when you want to select the same element type like in a form which have different attributes. The HTML of forms has reoccurring elements which may be best styled differently, for instance the input element is the same regardless of it's type so selecting the element via attribute is one way of styling input elements differently.

        <h2>CSS Positions & CSS3 RGBA</h2>
    </div>
        
    <section class="article-section" id="css-positions">
    <h3 class="sec-header">CSS Positions</h3>  
        
    <p>
        This week we reviewed CSS positions in more detail, throughout the ten weeks I have used many different posistions in CSS without fully understanding the concepts behind it. This weeks lecture helped me understand what positions do and how they effect the flow of the HTML document, I also researched elsewhere about how all the positions work and what they may be used for. <a id="cit-ref18" href="#cit18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
    </p>
        
    <div id="pos-sticky-example" class="position-example">
        This div is sticky!
    </div>
    <p>
        The sticky position acts like a relative position until the offset is met in the viewpoint then it 'sticks' and acts like a fixed position element. The sticky element is not supported until IE/Edge 15 and in safari I need to add another version with the '-webkit -sticky' as the position.
        The sticky div is only visible when viewing this section.
    </p>    
    
    <div id="pos-static-example" class="position-example">
        This div element, like all elements, is static by default.
    </div>
    <p>
        The above div has static position which means it follows the flow of the html document, this is the default position for all elements.
    </p>
    
    <div id="pos-relative-example" class="position-example">
        This div element is relative.
    </div>
    <p>
        The example above has the relative position, the element is removed from the normal flow of the document and offsets in CSS is given to place it relative to the static position. Relative position can easily cause overflow like appearance as move left by 10px on an element with 100% width will cause it to overflow it's parent by 10px on the right.
    </p>
    
    <div id="pos-fixed-example" class="position-example">
        This div element is fixed.
    </div>
    <p id="pos-fixed-desc">
        This fixed div is placed in the bottom right corner and is fixed regardless of scrolling. This is relative to the viewpoint and not it's parent element. The element is removed from normal flow. The div element is only apparent when viewing this paragraph. 
    </p>
    
    <div id="position-container">
        This div is a relative container. 
        <div id="pos-absolute-example" class="position-example">
            This div is absolute.
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The absolute position is very similar to the fixed position, however it is not relative to viewpoint but it's parent element. In the example above we have changed right to zero and top to 40px, giving the div element a position of absolute will place the element in the right corner of the containing parent element.

    <section class="article-section" id="css3-rgba">
    <h3 class="sec-header">CSS3: RGBA</h3>
    
    <p>
        RGB is a 24 bit representation of colours. Pixel colours are made up of Red Green and Blue. Each colour represents an unsigned byte, or 8 bits of information therefore in decimal each colour can range from 0 to 255 (2<sup>8</sup>-1). In Hexadecimal we can represent the colours using two Hex values for each colour channel, for example 0x0000FF would be hex for blue. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The 'A' in RGBA is the alpha channel, new to CSS3, which can specify the transparency of a colour. Unlike the other channels, the alpha channel is represented with an integer or percentage.

    <h2 class="sec-header">Tutorial Page Summary</h2>
        
    <p>
        A recipe is nice and simple and the format of the page for many websites is quite similar, it only makes sense that you wouldn't describe how to cook something before giving the needed ingredients. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The picture of the finished item is often shown first to the user, and this needed to be true for both desktop and mobile. This thought despite being specific became more abstract with the belief that on any page the user should see content that is immediately relevant and engaging. Therefore this caused a change in the whole design of the top of the pages, the menu was changed to be horizontal on the top including the "Learning Jearnal" and an Image that was set to 90vh with a title. To avoid to much scrolling I implemented a sliding flexbox element, the element is set at 400% the width while each slide was 25% of this width, the slide positions are changed by altering the left margin and with the use of transitions this gives a nice sliding effect. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The content of the recipe page is mostly lists both unordered and ordered, it made for a much clearer page with a simple purpose thats quick and easy to use. The instructions were kept minimal trying to achieve a user being able to keep two or more instuctions in the viewpoint even on a smaller mobile, such as a iPhone5/SE 320 x 560 px viewport. This would reduce excessive scrolling and make for a easier recipe to follow on any device.
    </p>
    <p>
        The video for the tutorial was originally placed at the top of the page, however this got moved to the bottom after realising my own behaviour when looking at other websites. In some scenarios watching a video is much easier then reading a page therefore the user may be inclined to just watch the video without ever seeing much of the actual page. Pages that are used for marketing will frown on minimal viewing of a page, it can also be argued that if a page requires a lot of scrolling to find a video when the user is looking for one then the user may just leave the page before ever finding it. The choice is really between whether getting views on the video of the page is the primary objective, if this is the case then the video being at the top of the page will lead to more plays per view. I compromised on this position using the slide technique described above the user would see the image of the pancakes and title on the landing page and with minimal scrolling would be able to navigate to the video slide with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conclusion of these points is that the style of the page should be driven by the content of the page, the way that content will be consumed by the target audience. The other driver is business, as in most aspects of software, the business objectives and targets will play a role in how a page maybe structured, obviously this should be within ethical boundries avoiding 'dark-patterns'.

    <section class="article-section" id="contact-summary">
    <h2 class="sec-header">Contact Page Summary</h2>
    
    <p>
        This page was quite simple to style for the most part, I did find it problematic with CSS selecting 'input' elements that had all different types that I wanted to space or style differently. I however after redisigning the page found that containing the inputs in semantically relevent divs helped reduce the need for type specific CSS selectors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that dealing with a label and the input as seperate entities was difficult and could cause rigid and bloated CSS so I wrapped these in a div with a class of "form-comp" short for form component which would be a label and it's input. I also would wrap these form components in other divs with a class of "form-group" simply grouping certain components together for semantic and display purposes.
        This wrapping and grouping of elements made it much easier to produce the format that is currently on the contacts page and replaced the long list of single label then input on seperate lines. I later changed this design after reviewing modern form and realising many rely on the text in the placeholder to describe the needed information, therefore I removed most labels and used placeholder text instead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML5 did provide for some more form attributes, I used quite a few of them in my form on the contacts page such as placeholder, required, pattern. Pattern being quite a powerful one that will get many developers who know how to use regex expressions very excited. I used pattern for validation on the phone number input as the input type 'tel' does not validate. I also found that I had to use pattern for email as the input type 'email' allowed users to type in a@c but with no "." suffix which is not correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last section of my contact page is a very simple example of user consent for contact. In reality this would need a 'Terms of Service' or equivelant where the details of what user information is saved and used and what rights each party has. However my example is specificly used to highlight what I think is ethical for developers, that choices by users should be automatically set to protect the users right to privacy and the user should be the driver in giving permission to the website.

    <h3 class="sec-header">Reflection</h3>
        
    <p>
        I found learning about HTML and CSS in this module very interesting for several reasons. The seperation of data from visual code is very good however I still feel that it is difficult to achieve a complete seperation between the two despite the improvements made by HTML5 and it's new semantic elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I stated before that I had some experience with CSS from using JavaFx. This module helped me understand the details of CSS and I appreciate how powerful CSS is and this will help greatly in the future with projects that use JavaFx. Website skills will also be very useful for possibly developing a interactive CV online for the future.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I also started learning some Javascript in order to aid some functionality I wanted in this website. The tooltip uses Javascript to add an element after a "glossary term" and will then use the information from that glossary term element to find the respective description in the glossary section of the website, this means glossary definitions only have to be updated once. I also used Javascript to show the "to top" button after a certain amount of scrolling had occurred on the page. The last bit of Javascript was used to show and remove the fixed element for the position example as to avoid having a fixed element throughout the web page, this element is only visible when the paragraph explaining the example is visible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The most difficult part for me is the design portion of building a website, I've never been one for design and have always been more focused on data and the technical parts of software. Therefore colour selection, fonts and image usage was always a volitle part of my website as I'd continue to change my mind or change after feedback from peers.
