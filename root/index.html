Html has a similar syntax to <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-xml-term">XML</a>, making it easier for me to understand, however html has defined tag names with specific semantic meanings and behaviour.

        <h3 class="sec-header">Elements</h3>
        
        <p>
            HTML has predefined tags as opposed to XML and this week we have learnt quite a lot of these tags, for example the anchor tag as discussed below. HTML5 with new semantic elements makes it more difficult to look at some examples before this new version as many div elements can be replaced with the new semantic tags.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The anchor tag defines a hyperlink in HTML5. It is normally used with a property of href, although not madatory and the tag will act as a placeholder for a hyperlink.<a id="cit-ref4" href="#cit4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Links can be relative or absolute, they join one web resource to another. Relative links are used to join resources found within the exisiting website folder.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-section" id="images">
        <h3 class="sec-header">Images</h3>
        
        <p>
            I learnt that images are placed with 'img' tags, however the knowledge of image formats and the original aspect ratio is incredibly important for displaying images appropriately. The alt property of an img tag can allow text readers to describe the image so I will put them on image to minimilize the difference in quality of the content despite how it is implemented. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In Html 5 the picture tag was introduced allowing an image to be mapped to a media query.<a id="cit-ref7" href="#cit7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The picture element allows aspect or size sensitive images to be replaced by a more appropriate image for the given device size.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Below are three examples all with a max width of 300px, all behaving differently due to their original respective size and aspect ratio and tags used to implement them.

            I learnt this week that before <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-CSS-term">CSS</a>, tables were used for designing the layout of a webpage. Tables should only used only for displaying tabular data, for example a copy of my timetable(below).

        <p>
            This week I learnt more about lists, in previous weeks we had learnt about unordered and ordered lists. I learnt that these lists could be nested making a sub list within a list item. I was also introduced to the description list which has terms and description elements, perfect for something like a <a href ="#glossary"><strong>glossary</strong></a>.

        <h3 class="sec-header">Blockquotes</h3> 
        
        <p>
            I learnt about using the blockquote element when quoting a cited source and using the cite element for citation of the quote. However once reading the Morzilla and the W3school cite reference it is clear that the use of this element can vary depending on whether the W3C or WHATWG specification is used.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
        
        <p>  
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
            It's worth noting that the W3C specification says that a reference to a creative work, as included within a &lt;cite&gt; element, may include the name of the work’s author. However, the <a class="glossary-term" href="#glossary-whatwg-term">WHATWG</a> specification for &lt;cite&gt; says the opposite: that a person’s name must never be included, under any circumstances.<a id="cit-ref11" href="#cit11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>

        <h3 class="sec-header">Linking & Inheritance</h3>
        
        <p>
            CSS, as mentioned previously, is used to control the displaying of Html elements. A Html document can include CSS directly with the style element or inline with the style property, however to completely seperate concerns the CSS should be in a seperate stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many Stylesheets can be used in a Html document and over the lifetime of the html document several references to the same element may be made. The Cascading notion in CSS, gives a simple clue that the order of styling makes a difference; however more then the order controls CSS inheritance. The below factors are what determine the style for any given element.<a id="cit-ref12a" href="#cit12"><sup>[12a]</sup></a>

        <p>
            Elements can be styled in a number of ways, use of the element names can allow for a common theme and colour. The use of CSS classes can be used to group similar elements like a menu for a consistent display and actions on hover. Then individual elements can be styled using an id which must be unique to that Html document.

    <p>
        Font size is often defaulted to 16px but this is not guaranteed and setting the size of the font in the body is good practice. 
        When styling text we can also set multiple font-family properties the first being the preferred option then listing down. There are also more then just the default fonts to use, many external sources provide stylesheets with fonts that can be included in the head of the html document. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        There are many other techniques to styling text and CSS allows complete control over how a text block will look. The below example is a simple block of text in html, however with CSS styling the look of it can be changed completely!

        <h3 class="sec-header">Grid Layout</h3>
        
    <p>
        The Grid view technique was used previously in responsive design and needed a mix of Html and CSS dependency to represent a theoretical column view. Columns normally would be equidistant so that html elements would have classes like 'col-9' to denote a size of 75% in a 12 column grid view. This was a concept I did not like at all and seemed like a step back from the seperation of view concerns with CSS. <a id="cit-ref13" href="#cit13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>

   <picture class="example-img">

        alt="Image of old site design before grid layout"/>
    </picture>
    <p>    
        The Grid Layout in CSS, coupled with media queries, allows for great customisation of Html elements completely from CSS. This is a much better technique allowing for easy control of element position and sizing while retaining and hooking onto semantic classes or ids. <a id="cit-ref14" href="#cit14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>

    <p>
        I have found that many websites use a mobile first approach to design. This is so the base content and styling work on mobiles before adding embellishments for larger devices. This can lead to websites designed with a pseudo anti-desktop pattern and often don't take advantage of the available space of larger desktop or mouse functionality. In principle mobile first approach is very logical but, with all media, the developer needs to determine the target audience of the website both present and future where possible and the opinion of the business.

    <h3 class="sec-header">Flexible Images</h3>
        
    <p>
        Images can be made flexible in many different ways and the techinique depends on the type of image, format and context, and where on the page the image is placed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An image can be 'clipped' on resizing of the page meaning that instead of overflowing by default causing a horizontal scroll bar the image is clipped. The benefit of this is that the image keeps it's original size regardless of resizing however this means that part of the image is not seen on smaller devices. This technique is best for some header images and images that are repeated multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Resizing image is another techinque which normally sets the max-width property of an image to the max width of the image so that the image quality is not ruined by upscaling. When the page size is reduced the image will then scale down respectively, this is very useful but developers need to mindful of how potentially small the image could become on small devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Flexible images can used in conjunction with the float property so they can be displayed next to text or another media. In the CSS the width property should be set to the percentage of the parent element it should take up, and the float property needs to be set.

    <h3 class="sec-header">Flexible Videos</h3>
     
    <p>
        I learnt this week about adding video frames to hold video media on my webpage, and how to style it to be flexible in CSS. 
        
        This week we learnt about using an &lt;iframe&gt; element for an embedded video, however in HTML5 there is a new &lt;video&gt; element which makes it far easier. <a id="cit-ref15" href="#cit15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p> 
        The video element can be scaled in a similar fashion to images which makes flexible media very consistent in HTML5.

    <h3 class="sec-header">Flexbox Layout</h3>
        
    <p>
        This week I learnt more about responsive design. In CSS3 the Flexbox layout allows for a card like interface which is very nice for styling of sequential information like tutorials. Flexbox is considered a one-dimensional layout as flexbox can only control either as a row or as a column <a id="cit-ref16" href="#cit16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.
